# Project-Game
A project for my Advanced Programming class

This game is called Tetris - a block-stacking game, where you need to place blocks of 4 square adjacent pieces (tetrominos) to a limited board and fill as many horizontal lines as possible to clear them.

The goal is to survive and score by clearing lines.

This version will be similar to NTSC Tetris with a bit of Modern Tetris.
